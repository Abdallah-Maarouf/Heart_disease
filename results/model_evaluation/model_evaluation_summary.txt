RECOMMENDations
---------------
Overall Best Model: Random Forest

Use Case Recommendations:
  High Precision Needed: Random Forest
    Reason: Best for minimizing false positives (avoiding unnecessary treatments)
  High Recall Needed: Random Forest
    Reason: Best for minimizing false negatives (catching all disease cases)
  Balanced Performance: Random Forest
    Reason: Best balance between precision and recall
  Probability Ranking: Random Forest
    Reason: Best for ranking patients by disease probability

Performance Insights:
  • Good overall model performance (>75% accuracy)
  • Significant precision-recall imbalance detected - consider class balancing techniques

Improvement Suggestions:
  • Consider hyperparameter tuning for better performance
  • Explore feature engineering and selection techniques
  • Try ensemble methods to combine model strengths
